        "title": "Shared Mobility: A Solution for Sustainable Cities",
        "description": "Shared mobility is becoming increasingly popular in major cities around the world as a means of reducing congestion and carbon emissions. The concept is based on the idea of several people using the same vehicle or transport service, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. Car-sharing platforms, bike-sharing services and electric scooters are all part of this growing trend. One of the main advantages of shared mobility is that it maximizes the use of existing resources. For example, a single car-sharing vehicle can replace several individual cars, reducing the need for new vehicles and parking space in the city. What's more, by combining shared mobility with electric vehicles, cities can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Governments are encouraging this transition by offering subsidies and creating suitable infrastructure such as cycle lanes and charging points for electric scooters. However, for this solution to be truly sustainable, it is essential to ensure equitable accessibility and to integrate these services into a broader public transport strategy.",
